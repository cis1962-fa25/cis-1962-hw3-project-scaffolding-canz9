Activity A: If you used AI
    1. Cite the usage by including screenshots or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the converstations you had with the AI.
Question: why is my npm run lint giving me errors?

AI response:
Your issues are just from ESLint 9’s new flat config system, so let’s set that up cleanly and ignore dist/.

I’ll give you a fresh, working ESLint 9 setup; you can just follow the steps.

1️⃣ Delete old ESLint configs
2️⃣ Create eslint.config.mjs (ESLint 9 flat config)
This does:

Tells ESLint 9 to lint only src/**/*.ts and tests/**/*.ts

Ignores dist/** and node_modules/** (no more .d.ts parsing errors)

Uses the TS parser so :, type, etc. are valid

Has 5 custom rules → satisfies rubric’s “4 extra rules”

3️⃣ Update your lint script

    2. Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adquete? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?
Yes, AI helped me more efficiently and directly, since I could ask it about my specific errors.

    3. Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?
I think I got a good answer that helped me with my problems.

    4. If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
